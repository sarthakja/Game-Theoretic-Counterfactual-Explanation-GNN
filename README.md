## Instructions
The code is presented in a single Google Colab Notebook. Running it requires minimal use of GPUs, the T4 GPU available in Google Colab should be sufficient. 

Currently, there are portions of code that need to be commented out to run specific functionalities(the description of what and how is clearly provided in the notebook). There are also specific sections that need setting of the paths of some files, again the description of that is given in the notebook. The files will be saved and used from google drive, so make sure that you have a Google account. Please go through the header comments above the code blocks to understand what parts need to be commented out, and what parts need setting paths. Finally, we will refactor the code so that path setting and commenting out is minimal.
